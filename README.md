<h1>Sales Fiend (working name)</h1>

Simple TUI proof of concept for a grocery sales scraper.

Should be able to input store and store's direct link to scrape the sales and output to a JSON file.

Sale prices are in price per unit instead of "regular" pricing. This is an important distinction. Studies show that consumers save up to 15% *per grocery trip* by using price per unit instead of final pricing.

Still a work in progress but I am actively fixing, adding, and tweaking it. Stay tuned.
